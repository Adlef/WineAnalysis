## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using the Wine Reviews dataset from 2017, found in Kaggle to better understand:

1. What are the countries with the best wine quality in the world?
2. What should be the average price for a good wine?
3. Which countries show the best potential for investment in wines?
4. Which variety are the top ones?
5. Which countries lead the varieties of wines?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Here is the data used for analysis and a notebook to showcase work related to the above questions. Steps of the analysis are described within the notebook.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@adlef01/is-the-wine-industry-definitely-established-7f779d078251?sk=74dde4d13ee2186dd85ba7161a77636f).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kaggle for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
